Please note this is a work in progress. The theme has not been created yet. This is what I am working towards. 

Welcome to your **primitive-jekyll** theme! This is where [Primitive UI](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive) meets [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). A front-end design toolkit built with Jekyll & Sass for developing responsive static websites. Primitive also provides helpful, browser-consistent styling for default HTML elements - buttons, forms, tables, lists, and typography.

Demo available: [here](http://woodcock3.github.io/primitive-jekyll/)


## Primitive UI

[![primitive-ui on NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/primitive-ui.svg?color=green&label=primitive-ui)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/primitive-ui)

The original [primitive UI](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive) and it's [documentation](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive) is available as a boilerplate/primitive framework for any project and its awesome. The beauty of Primitive is the ease with which you can create unique designs in a beautiful, simple system.

```

Now you can begin modifying variables in `variables.scss`. This file will define your colors, typography, sizes, breakpoints, buttons, borders, and more. Define all your variables here to keep your project organized.

You can view `dist/test.html` or `docs/template.html` to see some example elements as you make changes.

This gem offers some *main* layouts that can be used/edited:
- The `_layouts/default.html`, is the skeleton of the pages, where header,footer, assets are called. It should be used in most of the other layouts,
- The `_layouts/home.html` is the main layout the will be your home, where your blog posts will be shown;
- The `_layouts/post.html` is the layout used to present the blog posts themselves, where they will be rendered.

Inside the `_includes/` directory there are the partials that are used inside the layouts.

To edit the current JavaScript functions of the gem, the file you are looking for is in `assets/js/init.js`.

Your blog posts (`*.md` files) should be put in the `_posts` directory.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` tracked with Git will be released.
